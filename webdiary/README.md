### My PHP Learning Journey with WebDiary.
* the web diary application as its name implies is a web based diary that allows a user to register on the app and login to document their events just as diary is used for documenting events.

* the WebDiary allows users to:
- Create Posts
- Read Posts
- Update Their Post
- and to Delete post.

* will continue to update the files with codes as i continue to learn PHP so as to improve the web and also my programming skills in PHP.
